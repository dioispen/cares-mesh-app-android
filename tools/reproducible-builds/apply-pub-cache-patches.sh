# Applies the project's patches to third-party Dart packages in PUB_CACHE.
#
# pub has no patch mechanism, so a package that does not build against this
# project's toolchain can only be fixed by editing the extracted cache copy.
# Doing that by hand is how this repository ended up in a state where the build
# worked on one developer machine and nowhere else: the edit lives outside
# version control, is invisible to CI, and disappears on `pub cache clean` or a
# new checkout. Every such edit belongs here instead.
#
# Each patch pins both checksums. An upstream release that changes the file
# fails loudly rather than being silently re-patched, and an already-patched
# cache is left alone, so the script is idempotent.

# flutter_inappwebview_android 1.1.3 is the newest stable release and still
# calls getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'). AGP 9 removed that file
# outright because it carries -dontoptimize, and offers no compatibility flag,
# so configuring :flutter_inappwebview_android aborts the whole build. The
# optimize variant is what every current template uses.
#
# These proguardFiles sit in the plugin's own buildTypes block. An Android
# library contributes rules to a consuming app through consumerProguardFiles,
# not through these, so the substitution does not change the rules that reach
# this app's release build.
